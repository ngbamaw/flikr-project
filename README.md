# FlickrSearchEngine

## Disclaimer

When filling search input and typing enter 2 fields can appear. This is an issue with primeng. Only one tag will be sent to the backend

NSFW is enabled by default in Flickr's API even with `safe_search` set to `1`.

Some pictures can seem unrelated to the search you made but Flickr's API is based on the tags you put. We invite to add as much tags as possible to have a more precise search.

## Getting started

```bash
npm run start
```

## Test

```bash
npm run test
```
